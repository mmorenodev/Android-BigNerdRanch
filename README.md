Learning about Android with Big Nerd Ranch

Jetpack Compose is the future or Android development. 
There are many ways to write asynchronous code on Android, but in this book we focus exclusively using Kotlin coroutines as they are baked directly into Jetpack Compose's API as well as being excellent tools to interact with UI written with Android's existing UI toolkit. 

Reworked projects to follow the UNIDIRECTIONAL data flow architecture pattern. **The unidirectional data flow pattern is essential to building apps with Jetpack Compose- and it also helps organize code when building apps with Android's existing UI toolkit.**


## Activity
An activity is a class in the Android SDK. It is an entry point into your application and is responsible for managing user interaction with a screen of information. 

- You write subclasses of Activity to implement the functionality your app requires. A simple application may need only one subclass; a complex application may have many.
